# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-Project

A simulaiton of Conway's Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating zero-player game created by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It's a cellular automaton, where an infinite grid of cells can be either "alive" or "dead," and their states evolve over time based on simple rules. 
These rules determine how cells change from one generation to the next: a living cell with two or three living neighbors survives, while fewer or more causes it to die; a dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive. 
Despite the simplicity of these rules, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex, often chaotic, and even seemingly intelligent patterns, demonstrating how intricate behavior can emerge from simple systems. 
It has become a significant subject of study in mathematics, computer science, and artificial life, and remains popular for visualizing emergent systems and self-replicating patterns.

My first prototypes for this project were made with Python. I switched to HTML, JavaScript and CSS because I wanted it to be more web-based. The website.html file is where the bulk of the work is. I first wanted to understand how the logic behind the game worked. I needed to create a grid of cells, each with a value of either one or zero. Depending on the values of the surrounding cells, and the value of the cell itself, the value would either change or stay the same in the next state. This logic was simple enough; I used a double nested array for the grid of values, and getting the values of the surrounding neighbors was just getting the sum of the neighbors using loops. I then needed to actually animate the game. After I got that down, I worked on the code for manipulalting the simulation (The buttons and the ability to set any cell as living or dead). I was experimenting with different grid sizes. The grid size I had for most of the development of the project was a 30 by 30 grid. I thought that this was a little small, so I increased the dimensions until I settled for 65 by 65. 

I decided to use a bit of CSS code for the project, but I wanted to focus more on the actual game. I felt that going too crazy with the design of the web page wasn't necessary.
